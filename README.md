Firstly, the customers can either <strong>choose product attributes</strong> (size, color, etc.) <strong>before or after clicking the <em>Add to cart</em> button</strong> on the Category page. If they follow the first option, these attributes will be recorded and appear fully in the Ajax popup without reselection.

Then, the <strong>success popup with cart overview</strong> will be shown as soon as the store visitors click on the <em>Add to cart</em> button. Here, besides the cart information including product name, the number of items, and subtotal, this popup also display a related product block which you can use to enhance up-selling or cross-selling. After that, the customers can choose to <em>Continue Shopping</em> or <em>View Cart</em> by selecting an option in the popup.

As you can see, from the beginning to the end, there is no annoying page reloads but convenient Ajax popups.
